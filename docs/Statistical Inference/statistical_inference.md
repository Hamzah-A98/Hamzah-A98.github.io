# Statistical Inference

Statistical Inference is the process of drawing general conclusions about the population based on insights gathered from a sample. Often, when studying a population, collecting information from every individual is impractical or impossible. Thus, we rely on analyzing smaller samples and make informed inferences on the entire population. 

The field of Statistics is built on the question:

- How reliable are the conclusions drawn from a sample? 

Before we delve into answering the above question, let's go over a few defintions. 

### Parameter vs Statistic

- parameter: a number that summarizes entire population data.
- statistic: a number that summarizes sample data.

|          | Parameter | Statistic |
| :---------------- | :------: | ----: |
| Mean       |   $\mu$  | \bar{x} |
| Variance          |   $\sigma^{2}$   | $s^{2}$|
| Standard Deviation   |   $\sigma$  | $s$ |
