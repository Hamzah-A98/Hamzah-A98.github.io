# Statistical Inference

Statistical Inference is the process of drawing general conclusions about the population using insights gained from a sample.

The main question that we'd want to answer is exactly how reliable is the information that we gain from a sample? 

Before we delve into answering the above question, let's go over a few defintions. 

### Parameter vs Statistic

- parameter: a number that summarizes entire population data.
- statistic: a number that summarizes sample data.

|          | Parameter | Statistic |
| :---------------- | :------: | ----: |
| Mean       |   $\mu$  | 23.99 |
| Variance          |   True   | 23.99 |
| Standard Deviation   |  False   | 19.99 |
